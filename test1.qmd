## Libraries

Libraries or packages are collections of functions, datasets, packages

The first thing we do is to load the necessary packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
library(tsibble)
library(tsibbledata)
library(feasts)
```

## Tidyverse Packages

```{r}
hist(rnorm(1000))

```

We can observe that the histogram looks like a Normal/bell-shaped distribution.....

ARMA model:

$$
\phi(p) X_t = \theta(q)Z_t  
$$
